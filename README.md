*“Like Supabase typings, but with a lot more chaos.”*

## What is this?

**lawless-supabase** is a collection of half-baked tools glued together with mild-vetted vibe-coded slop.  
It’s basically Supabase type generation, but:

- ✨ *worse*  
- ⚡ *funny*  
- 🔥 *subject to API breakage without warning*  

Currently the **only** feature is:  

- Generate **Zod schemas** for a *tiny subset* of Supabase table types.  
  (Yes, it’s incomplete. Yes, it’s fragile. No, I don’t know if it’ll work on your database. Good luck!)

---

## Future Features (™️ maybe, who knows)

- 🐍 Python typings (because why not)  
- 📜 Better [migra](https://github.com/djrobstep/migra) support — but “better” here means “we use your DB as the schema and pray”  
- 🚨 More warning signs that you shouldn’t rely on this in production  
- 🍹 A general aura of chaos  

---

## Disclaimer ⚠️

- **APIs may change at a whim** (sometimes while I’m mid-coffee).  
- **Half of this code is untested vibe slop.**  
- **The other half is duct tape.**  
- **Do not yell at me when it breaks.**
